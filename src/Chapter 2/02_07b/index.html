    <p>Now that we have Flexbox and Grid, you may wonder if float and clear are still relevant. The answer is yes! But now, we
    get to use them as they were originally intended – for things like text-wrapping, and not as a hacky workaround for
    layouts.</p>
    <h2>Control with clear</h2>
    <p>The float property allows an element—like this image—to be positioned to the left or right inside its parent container.
    It removes the element from the normal document flow, letting surrounding content wrap around it. This is similar to
    "text wrap" in a word processor. For example, if I change this image to float: right, you’ll see the image move to the
    right, and the text automatically fills the space to its left.</p>
    <p>Once an item is floated, we need to control how adjacent elements behave. Should they wrap around it, or should they
    move below it? That’s where the clear property comes in.</p>
    <p>Back in the days of float-based layouts, we used clear a lot to prevent container collapse, which led to some confusion
    about how it actually works. Let’s clear that up. See what I did there?</p>
    <p>If you apply clear: right to an item, you are saying “nothing can appear - or float - to the right of this item”
      and adjacent siblings are literally cleared away from the space.</p>
    <p>Clear left prevents adjacent siblings from appearing on the left, clear right on the right, and clear both clears
      both sides.</p>
